* Intro
This repo is a offsite backup of my config files. I have made this public because I have learned a lot with configuring linux from others. at the moment its the same layout copied from my linux home directory. Files will be added and removed as it is needed.
* Things configured here
** Doom Emacs
for the most part not really changed
** AwesomeWM
working on getting a basic sepperated config where items are in their on file like key bindings in one file and the function that run them in another.
